  description: I collaborated with a team to orchestrate and lead an annual VR/AR hackathon at MIT. My responsibilities included designing workshops on digital fabrication and custom VR hardware, as well as managing relationships with sponsors and overseeing laboratory access for hackers. Additionally, I implemented a Python multistage graph traversal algorithm to organize an SQL database of over 500 hackers into hackathon teams, considering their skills, interests, and teammate preferences collected via an online portal.
