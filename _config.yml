about_me_description: Innovation emerges from systems—connections between people, connections between machines, and connections between people and machines. To this end, I engineer systems to fulfill researcher and consumer needs in order to propel the current reality into a more sophisticated, harmonious ecosystem. I studied mechanical engineering at MIT with a focus in Learning Machines and Physical Systems, and a minor in Computer Science. I've been involved in teaching engineering leadership and human-computer interaction at MIT, and I've also gained valuable research and professional experience in the fields of medical devices, robotics, AI, and human-computer interaction. My goal is to learn and apply these experiences to innovate solutions that bridge the digital and physical realms.
